# Code for Clock Radio

This is the code for the ECE 299 animal themed Clock Radio project. 

Note: The code borrows writer.py which is written under the MIT license, and is used to display a custom font. In this specific radio, I used writer.py with a custom font to display the main information in a traditional 7 segment display inspired font.
